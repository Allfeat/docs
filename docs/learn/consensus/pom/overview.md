# Proof-of-Metadata (PoM): Decentralized Truth Consensus for Music Data

## What is Proof-of-Metadata?

Proof-of-Metadata (PoM) is Allfeat’s **industry-specific consensus mechanism** designed to certify and protect music metadata in a decentralized way. Unlike generic blockchains that focus solely on transactional security, PoM adds a critical layer: **domain expertise**. It ensures that song credits, rights splits, ownership records, etc... aren’t just stored securely but are also _verified as accurate by the music industry itself_ and that they _reflect correct Web2 data_.

## Why PoM Exists

Traditional music databases suffer from:

-   🕳️ **Centralized Control**: Labels/DSPs may often gatekeep "truth".
-   🔄 **Version Chaos**: Conflicting edits across platforms.
-   💸 **Costly Disputes**: Legal battles over missing royalties.

**PoM solves this by**:

-   Turning subjective claims into **cryptographically signed facts**.
-   Replacing corporate gatekeepers with **crowd-validated truth**.
-   Making metadata **as trustworthy as the blockchain itself**.

## How PoM Works (At a Glance)

### Three Core Principles

1. **Community-Driven Validation**
    - Industry players (labels, artists, distributors) validate metadata, not anonymous miners.
2. **Skin-in-the-Game Economics**
    - Submitters lock collateral; trusters stake tokens. Bad actors lose funds.
3. **Immutable Version History**
    - Every edit creates a new record, preserving full lineage.

### Key Roles

| Role           | Responsibility                               | Incentive                         |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Providers**  | Submit metadata a.k.a MIDDS (e.g. new track) | Prove ownership, earn reputation  |
| **Trusters**   | Certify submissions by staking tokens        | Earn rewards, shape industry data |
| **Contestors** | Challenge incorrect data                     | Protect ecosystem, earn bounties  |

## Why Allfeat Needs PoM

1. **Industry Alignment**
    - Music data requires niche expertise (e.g ISRC, ISWC codes, rights owner shares...) that generic consensus (PoW/PoS) can’t verify, we don't want to re-import some Web2 data errors.
2. **Fraud Resistance**
    - Collateral (Providers) + staking (Trusters) make attacks economically irrational.

**Without PoM**, Allfeat would be just another database — not a **decentralized source of truth**.

## PoM vs Traditional Systems

|                        | Allfeat + PoM                | Centralized Databases    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Trust Source**       | Industry consensus           | Corporate authority      |
| **Data Integrity**     | Cryptographic proof          | "Trust us" policies      |
| **Dispute Resolution** | Transparent DAO voting       | Closed-door negotiations |
| **Update Flexibility** | Versioned, immutable history | Silent overwrites        |

## The Big Picture

PoM isn’t just a technical feature — it’s a **new social contract** for the music industry. By aligning financial incentives with data accuracy, Allfeat creates a system where:

-   🔗 **Artists** regain control over their credits.
-   🏛️ **Labels** reduce legal/compliance costs.
-   🌐 **Fans** access transparent data/song histories.
