# 🧩 Proof of Metadata (PoM)

The Proof of Metadata (PoM) system is at the heart of Allfeat.

It ensures that all the metadata stored in the network is **reliable**, **relevant**, and **verified by the music community itself** — not just by machines.

While the technical design of PoM is still being refined, its purpose is already clear:  
✅ Allow anyone to contribute metadata  
✅ Let professionals verify and certify what gets included  
✅ Keep the system transparent, fair, and valuable for the whole industry

_Note: PoM is still evolving. Some details may change over the coming months as we shape the right formula for a strong and balanced system._

## ❓ Why Do We Need PoM?

Storing metadata on a decentralized network is easy.

What’s hard — and **absolutely essential** — is making sure that metadata is:

- ✅ Accurate
- ✅ Complete
- ✅ Not duplicated or fake

Without a layer of human and social validation, a public metadata network would quickly fill with spam, errors, or self-promotional noise.

PoM solves that. It provides a **community-driven filter** to:

- Incentivize quality contributions
- Encourage peer review and collective validation
- Maintain long-term trust in the database

This makes PoM the **true engine** behind Allfeat’s value as a public, open metadata layer.

## 🧑‍🎤 The Key Roles: Providers and Trusters

PoM is based on a collaboration between two types of participants:

### Providers

These are the people or entities who **submit metadata** to Allfeat.

They could be:

- Artists
- Labels
- Collectives
- Rights organizations
- Independent contributors

To ensure quality and discourage spam, providers must:

- Lock a small amount of AFT tokens (collateral)
- Accept that their submission may be contested or rejected if inaccurate

Their incentive:  
The more high-quality data they contribute, the more they can earn over time from the protocol’s reward system.

### Trusters

Trusters are the community members who **validate and certify** the metadata submitted by providers.

They play a crucial role by:

- Reviewing MIDDS (Allfeat’s structured metadata objects)
- Voting to approve or reject submissions
- Helping challenge suspicious or invalid data

Trusters must also stake tokens to be eligible and accountable. Over time, their **reputation** grows as they participate honestly and constructively.

Only Trusters can participate in the final certification of a MIDDS.

## 🧱 What Does PoM Certify?

Allfeat does **not** host sensitive or private information.

Instead, it focuses on **Level 1 public metadata**, like:

- Song titles
- Artist names
- Recording details
- Release dates
- Contributors and roles

Once a MIDDS is certified through PoM, it becomes:

- Immutable (cannot be changed)
- Publicly available to all
- Timestamped and anchored in the network history

This turns Allfeat into a **shared truth layer** for metadata — visible and usable by everyone.

## 🧠 Why Is PoM So Powerful?

PoM brings something unique to Allfeat:

- A **human layer of curation** for public data
- A reward system aligned with real value creation
- A balance between openness and quality

Unlike traditional platforms where metadata is hidden or controlled by a few players, Allfeat offers:

- An **open platform**
- Backed by **professional review**
- And **rewarded** through transparent incentives

It’s not just a database — it’s a **living ecosystem** for metadata.

---

## 📌 Summary

- **PoM** is the mechanism that validates and certifies public metadata in Allfeat
- It involves **providers** (who submit) and **trusters** (who review)
- It ensures that metadata is **verified, structured, and publicly accessible**
- It is the key reason why Allfeat is a trustworthy, decentralized source of musical metadata
