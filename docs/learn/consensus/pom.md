# Proof-of-Metadata 🎵📜

## Introduction

Proof-of-Metadata (PoM) is the **consensus mechanism** that governs the certification of metadata on the Allfeat blockchain. Unlike traditional blockchain consensus models that validate transactions, PoM ensures the **authenticity, accuracy, and reliability of metadata** recorded on-chain. By leveraging economic incentives and decentralized validation, PoM establishes a trusted framework where metadata is not only stored but **certified as valuable and immutable**.

## How PoM Certifies Metadata 🏛️

PoM transforms metadata into **a provable and economically backed asset** by requiring submitters to **stake collateral** and go through a **community validation process**. This mechanism prevents spam, ensures data quality, and enhances the overall credibility of the Allfeat network.

### Core Principles 🔑

1. **Consensus-Driven Certification** – PoM acts as a decentralized consensus ensuring only valid metadata becomes permanently recorded.
2. **Economic Security** – Data providers stake collateral to guarantee the integrity of their submissions.
3. **Decentralized Governance** – The community of trusters verifies metadata before it becomes immutable.
4. **Immutable Certified Data** – Once a MIDDS is certified, it cannot be removed, reinforcing its value.
5. **Reward-Based Participation** – Contributors are incentivized through a reward pool, aligning economic interest with data accuracy.
6. **Reputation-Based Trust** – A scoring system ensures reliable participants gain influence over the certification process.

## 📝 Submission & Certification Process

### 1️⃣ Submission

-   Any AFT holder can submit a MIDDS.
-   A fixed fee is required per submission.
-   The provider must stake a collateral deposit as a guarantee for the data.

### 2️⃣ Review Period (21 days) ⏳

-   Trusters (any user with AFT) can contest a MIDDS submission.
-   If a MIDDS receives enough "No" votes, it is invalidated and removed.
-   If no contestation occurs, the MIDDS is certified and becomes immutable.

### 3️⃣ Contestations & Challenges ⚖️

-   Trusters signal contestations without upfront cost (network fees excluded).
-   A threshold-based system determines the validity of a contestation.
-   Reputation influences the weight of a truster’s vote.
-   Invalid MIDDS result in the provider losing their staked collateral, which is moved to the reward pool.

### 4️⃣ Certification & Finalization ✅

-   If a MIDDS passes the review period, it is **certified permanently**.
-   The provider's collateral remains **locked forever**, ensuring data permanence and value.

## 🎁 Rewards & Reputation System

### Reward Pool Distribution 💰

-   Tokens from the reward pool are distributed every X days.
-   Distribution is proportional to the total amount staked by providers.
-   Higher metadata contributions lead to higher rewards.

### Reputation Mechanism 🌟

-   **Providers:** Gain points for successful submissions; higher reputation may lead to submission prioritization or reduced fees.
-   **Trusters:** Gain points for accurate contestations and valid votes; higher reputation increases vote weight.
-   **No Negative Reputation:** Users cannot lose points below their starting reputation, preventing circumvention through new address creation.

## 🚀 Future Considerations

-   Implementation of metadata edit proposals under the same certification mechanism.
-   Optimization of the contestation system to prevent abuse (Sybil attacks, false competitive challenges).
-   Evolution of the reputation model to balance contributions and contestations effectively.

By enforcing a **strong economic and consensus model for metadata certification**, PoM ensures that the Allfeat network remains **the ultimate source of truth** for music metadata. The following sections will explore each component in greater detail.
