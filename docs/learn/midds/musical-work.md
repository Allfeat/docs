# Musical Work üé∂

## What is the Musical Work MIDDS?

The **Musical Work** MIDDS is the structure used to describe and register a **musical composition** in the Allfeat system. This includes both the **core metadata** of the work and its link to creators and rights holders.

Each Musical Work must be identified by a valid **ISWC** (International Standard Musical Work Code).

> ‚õîÔ∏è **Note**: Allfeat is not a new registration authority or identifier for musical works. It serves as a **decentralized, immutable mirror** of the industry's existing music metadata‚Äîsecured and verifiable on-chain.
