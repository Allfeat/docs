# Music Industry Decentralized Data Structures 📜

## What Are MIDDS? 🎶

MIDDS (**Music Industry Decentralized Data Structures**) are standardized, blockchain-certified metadata structures designed to **unify, authenticate, and preserve** music-related data on the Allfeat network.

In traditional music databases, metadata is often **inconsistent, fragmented, and prone to loss or manipulation**. MIDDS solve this by offering a **verifiable, structured, and immutable** way to store key information about musical works, rights, recordings, and performers.

## Why Do We Need MIDDS? ❓

Music metadata is the backbone of royalty distribution, rights management, and industry-wide collaboration. However, existing databases—whether proprietary or open-source (e.g., MusicBrainz)—lack **built-in trust mechanisms** and are often controlled by centralized entities.

### Problems with Traditional Metadata Management ⚠️

-   ❌ **Data Fragmentation**: Information is scattered across multiple databases, leading to inconsistencies.
-   ❌ **Lack of Verification**: Many metadata sources rely on user input without formal validation.
-   ❌ **No Economic Incentive**: Contributors have no direct motivation to maintain accurate data.
-   ❌ **Risk of Manipulation**: Centralized control allows for data alteration without consensus.

### How MIDDS Solve These Issues ✅

-   🔗 **Standardized Structures**: Ensuring interoperability across platforms.
-   🔐 **Blockchain Verification**: Making metadata **tamper-proof** and **auditable**.
-   💰 **Economic Incentives**: Encouraging accurate data contribution via **staking and rewards**.
-   🌍 **Decentralized Governance**: Letting the community, not a single entity, validate information.

## How MIDDS Work 🛠️

MIDDS define a **structured data format** for each key entity in the music industry. Each MIDDS entry follows a predefined template with essential attributes, making it easy to **link, certify, and retrieve** data.

For example:

-   **Party Identifier MIDDS** → Corresponds to data linked to the **IPI** (Interested Party Information) and **ISNI** system, identifying any actors of the music industry.
-   **Musical Work MIDDS** → Stores song-related data linked to the **ISWC** (International Standard Musical Work Code), including song titles, composers, and associated rights.
-   **Track MIDDS** → Captures release-specific data, such as the **ISRC** (International Standard Recording Code), identifying unique sound recordings.
-   **Release MIDDS** → Groups tracks into albums, EPs, or singles and links to an **UPC** (Universal Product Code) for distribution.

Each MIDDS is **immutable once certified** but can be updated via a governance process to ensure metadata accuracy over time.

## The Future of Music Metadata 🚀

By implementing MIDDS, Allfeat is transforming **music metadata from a chaotic, fragmented mess into a structured, shared, and economically sustainable asset**. This ensures that music creators, industry professionals, and even fans can rely on a **trusted, global, and decentralized** music data registry.
