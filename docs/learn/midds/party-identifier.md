# Party Identifiers üßæ

## What is the Party Identifier MIDDS?

The **Party Identifiers** MIDDS is the cornerstone structure that represents **all individual and organizational actors** in the music industry within the Allfeat ecosystem. It ensures that every entity‚Äîwhether a performer, producer, label, or publisher‚Äîis accurately and securely identified on-chain.

Each Party Identifier MIDDS is linked to at least one of the following global identifiers:

-   **IPI** (Interested Party Information) code
-   **ISNI** (International Standard Name Identifier)

> üõë **Important**: It is **not possible** to certify a Party Identifier MIDDS on-chain without a valid IPI or ISNI. This ensures that all actors referenced in the system **exist in the real world** and are verifiable through established, globally recognized databases.

Allfeat does **not** aim to introduce a new identification standard. Instead, it serves as a **decentralized, transparent, and tamper-proof mirror** of the metadata and identifiers already used across the music industry in Web2 environments.

## Structure of the MIDDS

The Party Identifier MIDDS is separated into two distinct categories:

### 1. **Legal Entities**

These are organizations such as:

-   Record labels
-   Publishing companies
-   Distributors

**Attributes:**

-   IPI Code\*
-   ISNI Code\*
-   Type (e.g., Editor, Producer, Distributor)
-   Name

### 2. **Natural Persons**

These are individuals, typically:

-   Songwriters
-   Composers
-   Performers

**Attributes:**

-   IPI Code\*
-   ISNI Code\*
-   Type (e.g., Solo Artist, Group Member)
-   Gender (Male / Female / Neither)
-   Full Name
-   Aliases / Stage Names

## Why It Matters üß†

The Party Identifier MIDDS plays a foundational role in building a **trustworthy, interoperable music database**. By anchoring identities to standardized industry codes, Allfeat ensures that all interactions‚Äîroyalty splits, rights declarations, and collaborations‚Äîare rooted in verifiable, real-world data.

This not only secures the ecosystem against fraud and impersonation, but also **streamlines interoperability** with existing rights management systems, PROs, DSPs, and more.
