# 🎓 Metadata Philosophy

## Introduction

In the music industry, **data comes first**.  
Before royalties, before rights, before recognition — there’s metadata.

But today, metadata is often:

- scattered across closed silos,
- hard to verify or access,
- redundant, incomplete, or even contradictory.

Allfeat is built on a simple principle:

> **What everyone relies on should be readable, verifiable, and buildable by everyone.**

## 🌐 Why Metadata Matters

Every musical work contains a complex network of information:

- Who wrote it? Who composed or performed it?
- What’s the official title? Duration? Release date?
- What other works, people, or recordings is it linked to?

This data is the **backbone of the entire music ecosystem**:

- It powers royalty distribution.
- It enables classification, recommendation, and discovery.
- It drives services for streaming, sync, publishing, and analytics.
- It feeds AI tools, collection societies, and catalog managers.

In short:  
➡️ **Metadata is the invisible fuel behind all musical value chains.**

## 🧠 Why a Data-Driven Economic System?

If data has value, then it deserves:

- a system for **contribution** (who added what),
- a system for **validation** (how quality is ensured),
- a system for **incentivization** (why people participate).

➡️ That’s exactly where a blockchain makes sense:

- Each piece of data is **anchored publicly**, with traceable context.
- Contributors **stake tokens** to signal confidence in the data.
- Validators **review and endorse** entries — transparently and collectively.

Importantly, Allfeat does **not** store legal contracts or private rights info.  
Instead, it offers a **reliable, neutral, and extensible base layer for public, verifiable data**.

## 🔎 Transparency Over Complexity

Allfeat embraces **radical transparency**:

- No proprietary logic.
- No privileged access for any actor.
- No monopolies on standards.

Every data entry on Allfeat is **public**, **auditable**, and **collectively maintainable**.

This doesn’t solve every legal or business issue.  
But it **removes massive friction** around data access, trust, and structure — which is where much of the industry's pain lives today.

## 🔗 Connecting Web2 and Web3 Through Real-World IDs

Allfeat doesn’t reinvent music identifiers — it **organizes** and **connects** them.

Each data structure (called a **MIDDS**) carries:

- an **Allfeat-native identifier**, automatically assigned on-chain,
- a **Real World Identifier (RW-ID)** from traditional standards (e.g., ISNI, ISRC, ISWC...).

This allows any stakeholder to:

- **query data using known IDs**,
- **verify its presence or relationships** in a decentralized graph,
- and **migrate Web2 catalogs to Web3** with no loss of meaning.

The RW-ID ensures **interoperability** between traditional and new ecosystems — and smooth adoption without fragmentation.

## 👥 A System Designed for Collective Stewardship

Allfeat introduces two key participant roles:

- **Providers**: users who submit data and stake tokens to back it.
- **Trusters**: users who review and validate data entries via certification votes.

This model, governed by the Proof of Metadata (PoM) consensus, makes it possible to ensure **high-quality, decentralized data** —  
without relying on a single central authority.

Trust is not assigned.  
It’s **earned** through on-chain actions and **economic alignment**.

## 🧱 So, How Is the Data Structured?

To support this system, Allfeat defines a set of custom data formats called:

> **MIDDS — Music Industry Decentralized Data Structures**

These are simple, modular, and linkable formats for representing:

- creative works,
- recordings,
- parties (individuals or organizations),
- and releases.
