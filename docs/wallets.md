# Wallet Recommendations for Allfeat

## Introduction

To interact with the Allfeat network, users require a digital wallet that is compatible with the platform's unique specifications. While Allfeat utilizes an address format compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) standards, it's built on the Substrate framework, which provides additional functionalities beyond what standard EVM can offer.

## EVM-Compatible Address Format

Allfeat blockchain addresses adhere to the EVM standard, starting with a `0x` prefix, encoded in the hexadecimal format. These addresses are derived from the public key of an account and are typically 40 hexadecimal characters long, representing the last 20 bytes of the Keccak-256 hash of the public key. This format ensures a degree of interoperability with many Ethereum-based wallets, though full functionality requires a wallet that supports both EVM and Substrate features.
