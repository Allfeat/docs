## What is Allfeat?


Allfeat is an innovative platform that hosts decentralized applications (DApps) through smart contracts, offering advanced features tailored for the music industry, aimed at both developers and validators. 
Additionally, the platform includes a robust Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) built for the music sector, ensuring that every network user has a say in decision-making processes.

## Features
