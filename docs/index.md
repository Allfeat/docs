# 🚀 Quick Start – What is Allfeat?

**Allfeat** is a **public, decentralized, and transparent metadata database** with a strong social consensus to certify them.

It enables industry to register, verify, and protect essential metadata in a shared, tamper-proof, and accessible system.

## 🧠 A Shared Foundation for Music Metadata

Allfeat focuses on storing and validating **level-1 metadata** – the kind that is **public**, **objective**, and **easily verifiable**.

Examples include:

- Song and recording titles
- Performer and contributor names
- Standard identifiers (ISWC, ISRC, IPI, ISNI...)
- Public metadata for releases and catalog entries
- Time-stamped proof of existence (via Allstamp)

The result is a **common reference** point that everyone in the industry can access and rely on, from creation to distribution and beyond.

## 📦 MIDDS: Structured Metadata for the Music Industry

At the heart of Allfeat are **MIDDS** — _Music Industry Decentralized Data Structures_.

These are standardized metadata objects designed to describe:

- **Parties industry** (performers, composers, editor, distributors, artists...)
- **Songs** (musical works)
- **Tracks** (recordings)
- **Releases** (albums, singles)

MIDDS link together to form a complete and searchable map of music metadata.  
They can be created, edited, and certified by the community.

## ⚙️ How It Works: Dual Consensus

Allfeat combines two consensus layers to ensure both technical reliability and metadata quality.

### ✅ Network Layer – Proof of Authority (PoA)

- Maintains the infrastructure and ensures secure operations
- Managed by a limited set of trusted validators
- Efficient and stable — ideal for a professional-grade registry

### 🧩 Social Layer – Proof of Metadata (PoM)

- Handles the submission and certification of metadata (MIDDS)
- Anyone can submit a MIDDS by locking a small amount of AFT tokens as collateral
- Trusted participants (Trusters) review and certify metadata through voting
- A challenge period allows community review before final acceptance
- Rewards come from a pre-funded pool, based on verified contributions

This system ensures metadata is **reliable**, **community-validated**, and **resistant to abuse**.

## 👥 Who Is It For?

Allfeat is designed for:

- **Creators and professionals** who want to register and protect their metadata
- **Music industry organizations** managing catalogs and identifiers
- **Developers and platforms** building tools, apps, or services around trusted metadata
- **Verifiers (Trusters)** who help ensure data quality and earn reputation over time

---

## 🌐 Built for Transparency

Allfeat is:

- **Open** – anyone can consult or contribute metadata
- **Durable** – once verified, metadata cannot be removed
- **Interoperable** – easy to connect with external systems
- **Transparent** – every action is traceable and accountable

There are no hidden databases. Allfeat is a **public metadata layer** for the entire music ecosystem.
