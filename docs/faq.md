## Validator Questions

### Q: How do I become a validator on Allfeat?
A: Becoming a validator involves staking tokens, setting up your node, and being selected into the validator set. For more details, visit [Initializing a Validator Node on Allfeat](validator-node/prerequisites.md) and [Running Your Node as a Validator on Allfeat](validator-node/running-as-validator.md).

### Q: What are the risks of being a validator?
A: Validators are responsible for securing the network and can be penalized for actions such as double-signing or significant downtime. Ensure your node is secure and operates consistently.

## Troubleshooting
